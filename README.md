## General Info
I wrote it to summarize all the knowledge I have gained over the past few months and years. I believe this project proves my skills and is going to help me become a Junior .NET Developer

## Technologies
* ASP NET Core 3 with C# 8.0 for API (REST API!)
* Angular 9 with Typescript 3 for Web Client
* Entity Framework 3.1 and T-SQL with MSSQL to store and operate on data
* Identity Server 4 for security (I think it may be a bit confusing why, I'm explaining it later)
* NUnit 3 for testing if everything works (and obviously it does :>)

## Features
* API can sort, filter, paginate, display only particular fields. Almost everything you wish!

## To Do
* Implement most of API's functionality, to be honest I just started writing the client

## Project Status
60% complete

## Few more things
### Why I decided to use Identity Server 4?
I just really wanted to use it anywhere. And then I started this project. I know it's almost like using a combine-harvester to cut grass in your garden, but if it's possible, then why not?
